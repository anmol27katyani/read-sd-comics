Read SD Comics

With a cheap SD card you can add 2-8 gigabytes of storage to your XO laptop, but because the Journal only uses 
internal storage your SD card isn’t much use. Read SD Comics may change the way you think about your SD card. 
It’s a stripped down version of View Slides: no sharing, multiple bookmarks, or annotations, and no ability 
to update the contents of a .CBZ file. Instead of storing the CBZ in the Journal you store them on your SD card. 
Read SD Comics creates a pointer to the CBZ file when you start it from the Activity Ring. That pointer, plus 
the usual metadata, is what is stored in the Journal entry. When you resume the Journal entry it opens the file
on your SD card and returns to the page you left off on.
